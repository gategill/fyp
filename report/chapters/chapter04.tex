In this chapter is about: Bootstrap

\section{Background}
The idea

Bootstrapping is a resampling method is commonly used in science to achieve more confident results when only limited data is available. It works by ()

In our case, we introduce bootstrapping to the K-Nearest neighbour algorithm to 

\section{Design}
How does it works?
Algorithm!!!
Equations!!!

\section{Implementation}
Issues or challenges when implementing it?
Challenges of passing in model to Elliot

We implemented Bootstrap in two separate ways. One as its own model and another as a generic iterative model that takes in parameters in the configuration file
One of the main issues was passing in new recommendations back into the training data

\section{Comparison to Previous Algorithms}
Less sparsity, longer to train
