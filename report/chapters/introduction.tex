For this project, I used the open-source framework Elliot[] to create, test and compare models. Elliot lets us load and filter data, test models, find hyperparameters and compute metrics by providing a simple configuration file. Elliot plays an important role in ensuring that the experiment is reproducible and thus verifiable and comparable to other research.

1. Zhang and Pu [36] proposed a recursive algorithm that can make coarse predictions for the missing rating values of neighbouring users, thus alleviating data sparseness. The proposed approach shows promising results, achieving higher prediction accuracy than the conventional approach using PCC. ...
